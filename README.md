The App presents the collection available at the Art Institute of Chicago allowing the purchase of them by the user.
This is a non-profit project only for study-case related to development of web applications using React + Vite technology. 
The commercial values presented are only didactic, so they do not reflect the real value of the collection in any circumstances.
